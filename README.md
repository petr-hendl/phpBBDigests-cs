If you have installed this extension and you would like to add Czech language too, do the following steps:

1. Click on "Clone or Download" and select "Download as ZIP"

2. Once downloaded, unzip the zip file to a temporary location.

3. In the temporary location you will find folder `phpBBDigests-cs-master\language\` In this folder there is a directory `cs`. 
Copy it to your web server - to the phpBB installation, folder `ext/phpbbservices/digests/language`. You will find folder `en` 
there; copy the `cs` next to it.


If you need an older version of the translation (compatible to an older version of the Digests), select the corresponding branch.
